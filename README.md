Build Bugz a game build with an Html 5 canvas, Javascript game engine, and with the help of the sweet alert library. It came together very smoothly. 

The Javascript game engine functions as a flipbook and continues to render the images that it is given repeatedly over 50 times per second approximately. The game assets and functionality can be found on app.js and engine.js. resource.js serves a way to cache the common images used in the application to speed up the game's performance.
